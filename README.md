## Hello! This is a new thing I'm trying. 
When you're solving a problem using a tool or utility you've used before, do you ever ask yourself "what's going on one level lower"? If someone asked you what happens when you type `ls` into a terminal, would you be able to answer that? Where would you have to stop and say "I actually don't know what happens past this point"?

This will be a collection of "deep..er dives" into things I find interesting or useful.
